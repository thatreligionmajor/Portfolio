### Built With
My personal portfolio, <!-- my portfolio url --> which features some of my github projects. <!-- as well as my resume and technical skills. -->

This project was built using these technologies:

- React.js
- Node.js
- CSS3
- VSCode
<!-- - Vercel -->

### To Run
```console
your@githubhandle âžœ /workspaces/your-repo-name (main):~$ npm run dev
```
### What I Learned
This project allowed me to learn how to use React's forwardRef hook for the first time, as well as how to create some beautiful fade-in animations.
### Special Thanks
Thank you to Shane Bell, for inspiring me to get started on my own portfolio!
